# favorites-quiz 🎉

This is my second Python project — a small interactive quiz! 🧠

## 📝 What it does

This script asks the user for their **name** and a few of their **favorite things**, then prints a fun summary at the end.

It uses:
- `input()` to ask the user questions
- `print()` to show a result

## 📄 Files

- `favorites_quiz.py`: The main script
- `README.md`: This file you're reading

## 🧪 Example Output

```text
🎉 Welcome to the Favorite Things Quiz! 🎉

What's your favorite food? Pizza
What's your favorite animal? Dog
What's your favorite color? Blue

Nice to meet you, Giuseppe! So you love Pizza, your favorite animal is a Dog, and you like the color Blue!

▶️ How to run
